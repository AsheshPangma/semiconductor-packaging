Ansys EDS
Flip chip BGA package

package constitute


Tools in Ansys: 
HFSS -> For electromagnetics

We use Ice pack for thermal analysis for packages

Thermal boundary condition on edges
Specify what we monitor
This is Finite Element analysis thus we need mesh here
Analysis -> Solve equations and analyse results

EMU have different boundary conditions

Draw geometry and create different package
Here, no 3D model but to analyse the package, its components and settings of the package. We import inbuilt package available in Ansys

Import flipchip_BGA package -> Provide dimensions for the package -> see the datesheet -> 

Dimension:

Die:

Substrate:

Solder:


QFN
Which wires can be damaged due to exposure to high temperature.



***MODULE 4***

Testing at different stages ->  Goal -> Diagnosis, failure analysis -> yield of the process is effected

Foundry


OSAT

Testing Area -> (Electrical, burn-in, reliability chamber tests)
Test done in package board
Types of tests -> 
AOST    -> Assembly Open and Short Test, Functionality test
	-> Test shorts and opens on package leads or balls
	-> Die crack can occur

Burn-in test(important test) -> Apply thermal and voltage stress to ensure early-life reliability
				-> Test of package under elevated (stressful) conditions such as temperature, voltage and power cycling
				-> total life span of the component may be shortened with the test

Final test      -> A temperature corner test to verify that the package meets the specification
		-> cold and hot test for validating functional, parametric and reliability specs across temperature
		-> Automatic Test Equipment (ATE), Electrical testing unit with handler	-> Parametric tests, functional test, speed tests
		-> Yield, Testing time and Test coverage are key performance indicator during testing	





***MODULE 5***

Create the semiconductor package cross-section in Ansys AEDT
Create a virtual model of the package cross-section till molding/sealing stage


Thermal performance of the package + Electrical performance -> Can be done after meshing

Here we build package cross section only
-> Create the die and Substrate in AEDT -> Start with Q3D -> extracts paracitics from the design
-> Create a die with dimension of 3x3 mm, Thickness of 200 micron -> High bandwidth applications have thickness in the range of 30 microns

 
Die -> Substrate -> Die attach -> Create bond pads -> wire bonding

Applying mold compound and finalizing the package Model
